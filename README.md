# Interactive-Rating

**my process**
I used the DOM to handle user interaction and updating the HTML and CSS.

**my stack**
HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS

**what I learned**
I learned more about for loops and using the DOM.

**what I realized I need to improve on**
My understanding of for...of loops and forEach loops. I also want to improve my understanding of event listeners. I feel like I understand it on the surface level, but when going into details and targeting specific elements within the loops is quite challenging.

**continued development**
I intend to use jQuery for future projects as its more faster and requires cleaner code.
